<a name="description"></a>
Are you tired of not having anything to play?
Too many terrible games on the market?
Too poor to afford anything in this microtransaction-rich environment?
Maybe you're bored of playing connect 4? (don't worry, we get it!)

In that case, allow us to introduce our game, connect five.
Traditionally called Gomuku, Connect Five is a game where players take turns putting markers 
on a 15x15 grid. In this version, one player uses the 'X' character, while the other player
uses the 'O' character.
The goal of the game is to form an unbroken line of five chips in any direction. 
These directions are vertically, horizontally, or diaonally.
